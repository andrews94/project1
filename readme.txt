The approach taken was a simple hangman design that allows the first player to input a word and the second player to attempt 8 letter guesses to solve the word.
To play, start by having player 1 load up the page, and enter a word into the prompt window.  The word entered will be used for the game.  Make sure player 2 does not see what word was entered.  Once a word is entered
player 2 can begin guessing by entering a letter into the field and hitting the "guess" button.  All wrong letters will be displayed in the "wrong letters" section.
Some unsolved problems include the guess field not clearing after the entry is submitted, the score counter is not functional and will not track the score.  I would have liked to allow the user to input multiple words to play but I could not successfully implement a loop for my solution.

To assist me in this project, I used several external resources and references.  I got ideas and improved on code from https://codepen.io/offline_blogger/pen/Kedtr that helped lay the foundation for my project.  I used stackoverflow many times to learn things like implementing audio, calling ID's and other things.
These resources really allowed me to break down my code fundamentally and gave me a much better understanding of what i wanted to accomplish.  I was able to use parts of the code to assist me in areas I was stuck in, and I made improvements that made the code more efficient.  I added other elements to make the game more interesting and usable for 2 players.  Stackoverflow did the same in that it gave me a lot of assistance in my code and helped me improve some of my efficiency when writing.  Doing this project taught me that the answer to most of our questions can be found with a simple google search.  I also used soundbible.com for my audio clips.

As a user, I should be able to enjoy the game with few errors/hiccups so that it is a fun process.
As player 2, they should be able to guess the word correctly within 8 tries so that I don't kill the little person.
As an instructor, they should be able to read the code easily so it can be reviewed and improved on by myself.
As a user, I should be able to hear the sounds of victory or defeat so that I get the full game experience .
As player 2, they should be able to see how long the word is based off of the # of dashes.
As a user, I should be able to update my game for holidays and seasonal changes so that it is festive for all users.
